## Why I Started MAIR (Moroccans in AI Research)

Artificial Intelligence has moved from obscure research labs to becoming the centerpiece of everyday conversations. And yet, in Morocco, much of the cutting-edge research in AI still feels disconnected from public awareness, national strategy, and‚Äîmost crucially‚Äîfrom each other.

This is not just a story about technology. It's about visibility, opportunity, and the power of connection.

## The Motivation Behind MAIR

A few months ago, I came across a beautiful initiative by Badr, a fellow AI researcher, who created ‚ÄúEgyptians in AI Research‚Äù. His goal was simple yet powerful: make Egyptian scientists in AI visible, accessible, and aspirational for the next generation. That struck a chord with me.

Because I‚Äôve seen a similar reality in Morocco.

When Moroccan researchers leave the country to pursue PhDs or postdocs abroad, many of them go on to publish in top-tier conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, and ICML. But within Moroccan institutions, it‚Äôs a different story. The talent exists, but the ecosystem often lacks the resources, mentorship, and exposure to thrive.

That gap is what MAIR was born to address.

## Building Bridges Between Two Worlds

MAIR‚ÄîMoroccans in AI Research‚Äîis an initiative to connect two worlds:

Moroccan researchers abroad who have access to research labs, international conferences, and mentorship.
Moroccan PhD students and early-stage researchers at home who are full of potential, but often lack the environment to fully realize it.
By bridging these two groups, MAIR aims to:

Enable collaboration and mentorship.
Create visibility for Moroccan talent in AI.
Offer guidance on navigating academia, publishing, and research careers.
We Need Experts, Not Just Opinions
Another motivation came from observing the media landscape. When AI is discussed on TV or in podcasts, it‚Äôs rarely actual AI researchers being invited. Instead, we see vague commentators, business influencers, or tech-adjacent profiles. MAIR will help change that. We aim to build a visible directory of experts so the next time someone needs a voice for a panel or policy discussion‚Äîthey‚Äôll find real researchers who‚Äôve done the work.

## MAIR Is a Community, Not Just a Platform

From students curious about AI to senior scientists working at global labs, MAIR is a growing, intergenerational network. We believe in knowledge-sharing, mentoring, and fostering a culture of excellence. We're not here to replace institutions‚Äîwe're here to make Moroccan AI research more connected, confident, and future-ready.

## Looking Ahead

We‚Äôre just getting started. We're building the foundation through a community, resources, and partnerships. One of our key projects this year will be the State of AI Research in Morocco, a national report to map out the researchers, institutions, and research output across the country.

If you're a Moroccan in AI‚Äîwhether you're publishing at NeurIPS or just reading your first ML book‚Äîyou have a place in MAIR.

Let‚Äôs build it together. üß†üá≤üá¶
